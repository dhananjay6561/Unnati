# AI/ML for Network Security

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for automated network traffic analysis, threat detection, and anomaly identification. The system will leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify network traffic, detect malicious activity, and provide real-time, privacy-preserving security insights.

## Goals
- Automated network traffic classification (e.g., application identification)
- Real-time threat and anomaly detection
- Privacy-preserving analysis of encrypted traffic
- Scalable and efficient performance for high-traffic environments

1. Problem Understanding & Requirement Analysis
2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Baseline Model Development
5. Advanced AI/ML Model Development
6. Real-Time Traffic Analysis System
7. Threat Detection & Anomaly Identification Framework
8. Evaluation, Optimization & Scalability
9. Presentation, Documentation & Packaging
